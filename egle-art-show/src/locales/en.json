  "home.abstract_art_description": "is a diverse and expansive genre that encompasses a wide range of artistic expressions and styles. Emerging in the early 20th century as a radical departure from representational art, abstract art seeks to convey ideas, emotions, and sensations through non-representational forms and visual elements.",
  "home.abstract_art_forms": "It can take many forms, including geometric abstraction, where shapes and forms are distilled into their purest essence; gestural abstraction, which emphasizes spontaneous, expressive brushwork and mark-making; and color field painting, which explores the emotional and psychological impact of color and form on the viewer. Abstract art, as a theory, is rooted in the idea of liberation from the constraints of representational forms and traditional artistic conventions.",
  "home.abstraction": "One of the key principles of abstract art is abstraction, the process of simplifying or reducing visual elements to their essential characteristics. This can involve breaking down objects or scenes into geometric shapes, experimenting with non-representational forms, or exploring the interplay of color and texture in purely expressive ways.",
  "home.abstract_art_theory": "Overall, abstract art theory celebrates the transformative power of creativity, encouraging artists and viewers alike to embrace ambiguity.",
  "home.art_voice": "“Art has a voice - let it speak.” ― Rochelle Carr"
